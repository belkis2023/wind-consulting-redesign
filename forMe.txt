to fix later:
- create two pagination modes: blue one and white one
- fix the logo cut in mobile view + desktop!! for the chiffres-cles section
- rename client-card => mini-card
- for the snap-to-card effect, you can divide the container width by the number of cards
- fix the button on the hero card on sm view
-  make the scroll dynamic aka add the rest from the whole container offset width divided by the number of elements/cards
(news section)
- fix the nws section (make the width smaller depending on the screen(we don't always need scroll, just smaller cards)
- make a bigger font size for the title in the news section
- make the news section title scrollable
- the orbit cards: add the svg icons effect (the gradient thing)
